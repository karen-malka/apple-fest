                        <p>&#10067; How much money should I bring?</p>
                        <p class="tab"><em>&#127822; Entry to the event is completely free! The amount of money you should bring is dependent on what, if anything, you wish to purchase at the festival. If you plan to eat at the festival, you may also wish to bring at least $10. Prices of the various baked goods, produce, and crafts vary by vendor.</em></p>
                        <p>&#10067; Can I pay with a credit card?</p>
                        <p class="tab"><em>&#127822; Most of our vendors accept credit cards, however, you should bring some cash in case a shop you are interested in does not accept them.</em></p>
                        <p>&#10067; When is the best time to attend?</p>
                        <p class="tab"><em>&#127822; If you are looking to avoid the crowds, attending midday Friday is a good idea. However, many attendees find that the crowds on the weekend add to the energy and fun of the festival.</em></p>
